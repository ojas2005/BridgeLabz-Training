### 18 December – Introduction to C# Programming
On this day, I began my journey with **C# basics**. I focused on understanding the fundamental syntax, structure, and logic of the language.
To reinforce these concepts, I solved around **10–12 basic problems**, which helped me become comfortable with writing simple C# programs.

I also practiced organizing my code by uploading solutions to:
* `gcr-codebase` directory
* `leet-code-codebase` directory

This step helped me develop good habits such as maintaining code repositories and tracking progress through version control.

**Outcome:**

* Built confidence in basic C# syntax
* Understood how to structure and store solutions efficiently

### 19 December – CLR, MSIL, and Programming Elements

I studied the **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** and **MSIL architecture**, which gave me a deeper understanding of how C# code is executed internally.
I learned how source code is compiled into Intermediate Language and then executed by the CLR.

Additionally, I covered:

* Data types
* Operators

I implemented these concepts through code in the **programming-elements** directory and solved **Level 1 problems** inside the `c#-programming-elements` directory.

These problems helped me understand how data is stored, manipulated, and processed during program execution.

**Outcome:**

* Clear understanding of C# execution flow
* Strong grasp of data types and operators


### 20 December – Level 2 Programming Elements and Control Structures

I solved **Level 2 problems**, which were more challenging and required taking user input and performing logical operations.

While solving these problems, I learned new and important concepts such as:

* Conditional statements
* Looping constructs

These concepts allowed me to control program flow and execute repeated logic efficiently.

**Outcome:**

* Improved logical thinking
* Ability to write interactive programs using user input
* Readiness to handle more complex problem statements


### 22 December – Control Flow Concepts

I studied control flow concepts in detail and solved **Level 1 problems** related to:

* If-else statements
* Basic loop usage

These problems tested decision-making logic in programs.
I also solved some **Level 2 control flow problems**, which involved nested conditions and more complex loops.

**Outcome:**

* Strong control over decision-making logic
* Better understanding of loops in real scenarios


### 23 December – Advanced Loops and Introduction to Arrays

I completed **Level 2 problems** and moved on to **Level 3 problems**, which were more advanced and tested my deep understanding of:

* While loops
* For loops

After solving these problems, I pushed the code to GitHub, improving my experience with version control.

Later, I studied **arrays**, including:

* Array initialization
* Taking array input from users
* Accessing and modifying elements

I solved **Level 1 array problems**, where I applied control flow logic using arrays.

**Outcome:**

* Mastery of loops
* Clear understanding of single-dimensional arrays
* Experience combining arrays with conditional logic


### 24 December – Multidimensional Arrays and Methods

I learned about **multidimensional arrays** and how to use loops to traverse them effectively.
I then solved **Level 2 array problems**, which required advanced logic and efficient loop usage.

After that, I studied the theory of **methods** and attempted **Level 1 problems**, focusing on:

* Code reusability
* Breaking problems into smaller logical units

**Outcome:**

* Ability to solve complex array-based problems
* Understanding of modular programming using methods


### 25 December – Methods in Depth

I solved **Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 problems** related to methods.
Many of these problems reused earlier logic, but this time the logic was implemented inside methods.

This reinforced the importance of:

* Clean code
* Reusability
* Better program structure

**Outcome:**

* Strong command over methods
* Improved program readability and structure


### 26 December – Strings and Mini Project

I studied **string concepts**, cleared doubts, and applied them to solve **Level 1 string problems**.
This helped me understand:

* String manipulation
* String comparisons
* Built-in string methods

After that, I solved the **Snake and Ladder problem**, where I developed a **2–4 player game** with additional twists.
This problem helped me combine multiple concepts such as loops, conditions, arrays, strings, and logic building.

**Outcome:**

* Practical understanding of strings
* Experience building a mini-project using core C# concepts


### 27–28 December – Weekend Break

These days were kept as rest days, allowing me to revise concepts mentally and prepare for upcoming advanced problems.


### 29 December – Scenario-Based Problem Solving

I worked on **two scenario-based problem sets**:

1. String-based problems:

   * String Formatter
   * String Analyzer

2. Array-based problems:

   * Grades problem
   * Temperature problem

While solving these, I learned practical **use cases of built-in string functions**, which improved my efficiency and code quality.

**Outcome:**

* Real-world application of strings and arrays
* Exposure to scenario-based problem-solving


### 30 December – Advanced Scenario-Based Applications

I solved **two advanced scenario-based problems**:

1. **Role-Based Accessible Library Management System**

   * Search books
   * Rent books
   * Store books
   * Implemented role-based access control

2. **Student Evaluation System**

   * Compared student answers with actual answers
   * Generated results such as pass or fail

These problems helped me understand how programming concepts are used in real systems and applications.

**Outcome:**

* Experience designing real-world systems
* Improved problem-solving and logical structuring skills
