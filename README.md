Learn and revised Common Language Runtime(CLR) and MSIL architecture and covered the topics of datatypes and operators and implemented these concepts via code in the programming elements directory.
Solved Level-1 problems inside c#-programming-elements directory which helped me in understanding the basics of Csharp.

Solved Level 2 problems inside c#-programming-elements directory.
The Level 2 problems checked my knowledge to take user inputs and perform various operations on those values.
Overall it helped me to practice and boost my knowledge on the basics of c#.
After solving the problems I learnt new concepts like conditional statements and loops in c# which I will be using in solving more complex problems coming ahead.
