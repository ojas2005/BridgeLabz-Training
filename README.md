***18 December***
Learnt Basics of Csharp and solved 10-12 problems using those concepts.Uploaded few solutions in gcr-codebase directory and few solutions in leet-code-codebase directory.

***19 December***
Learn and revised Common Language Runtime(CLR) and MSIL architecture and covered the topics of datatypes and operators and implemented these concepts via code in the programming elements directory.
Solved Level-1 problems inside c#-programming-elements directory which helped me in understanding the basics of Csharp. 

***20 December***
Solved Level 2 problems inside c#-programming-elements directory.
The Level 2 problems checked my knowledge to take user inputs and perform various operations on those values.
Overall it helped me to practice and boost my knowledge on the basics of c#.
After solving the problems I learnt new concepts like conditional statements and loops in c# which I will be using in solving more complex problems coming ahead.

***22 December***
Studied the material for control flows and Solved Level 1 Problems of control flow.
Those problems checked my knowledge realated to basics conditional statements,more of if-else statements and few of them had loop concepts in that.
Solved some of the level-2 problems as well which were little bit more difficult than level-1 problems and most of them had loop concepts.

***23 December***
Completed level-2 problems and then headed to solve level-3 problems which was more advanced and checked my depth knowledge about while and for loops. After Solving those problems I pushed those files on GitHub.
Then I studied Arrays concepts- basics of arrays,how to initialise an array,how to take elements of an array throuh user input etc.
Solved Level-1 Arrays practice problems which contains few problems from control-flow topics but I was given to solve those problems using Arrays.
